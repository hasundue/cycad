## Contribution guidelines

### General

- The author is strongly opinionated about every aspect of coding, which is why
  this project exists. Your contribution is always appreciated, but not always
  accepted.
- If you want to contribute, you might better open an issue first, so we can
  discuss the problem and the solution.

### Code

- Commit messages should follow the
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  specification to be merged into the base branch.
- If your pull request contains any commit that does not follow the
  specification, it will be squashed by the author before merging.
